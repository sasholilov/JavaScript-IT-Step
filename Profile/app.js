  // When one of the [Show more] buttons is clicked, the hidden information inside the div should
  // be shown, only if the profile is not locked! If the current profile is locked, nothing should happen.

  // If the hidden information is displayed and we lock the profile again, the [Hide it] button should not be working!
  // Otherwise, when the profile is unlocked and we click on the [Hide it] button, the new fields must hide again.
